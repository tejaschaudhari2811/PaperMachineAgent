paper products with special properties or to facilitate the
papermaking process. Wet additives include resins and waxes
for water repellency; fillers such as clays, silicas, and talc;
inorganic and organic dyes for coloring; and certain inorganic
chemicals (e.g., calcium sulfate, zinc sulfide, and titanium
dioxide) for improved texture, print quality, opacity, and
brightness.


The processed pulp is converted into a paper product via a
paper production machine, traditionally a Fourdrinier type
machine, but increasingly using proprietary twin-wire systems.
In paper machines, the fiber slurry is deposited on a moving
wire belt that carries it through the first stages of the process.
Water is removed by gravity, vacuum chambers, and vacuum
rolls. This excess water is recycled to the fiber recovery step of
the process due to its high fiber content. The continuous sheet
is then pressed between a series of cylinders to remove more
water and compress the fibers.


After pressing, the sheet enters a drying section, where the
paper fibers begin to bond together as steam heated cylinders
compress the sheets. In the calender process, the sheet is
pressed between heavy rolls to reduce paper thickness and
produce a smooth surface. Coatings can be applied to the
paper at this point to improve gloss, color, printing detail, and
brilliance. Lighter coatings are applied on- machine, while heavy
coatings are performed off-machine. The paper product is then
spooled for storage.

Notes:

kg/ADt = kilograms of pollutant per 1,000 kg of air dry pulp
a Cooling water and other clean water are discharged separately and are not
included.

b Any nitrogen discharge associated with the use of complexing agents should
be added to the figure of tot -N.
c Because of higher kappa number after cooking for magnefite process the BAT

associated level is 35 kg COD/ADt.
d Does not include process water from the paper mill in integrated sulfite pulp
mills.
